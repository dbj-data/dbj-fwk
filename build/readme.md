# Multi Target Builds

This has to follow the hosting app builds. This is static library.

## Directory structure

All building artefacts are under the build folder. Thus they are decoupled from the code.

Publich headers are "in the front", in the library top folder.

When building the hosting app, you reference these projects, VStudio picks the right lib files. 

This is one-to-one. Hosting app is built following the same paradigm as in here. One hoting app build link one li build from here.

## Main build attributes

1. Compiler: clang-cl  or cl
2. C++ exceptions or no C++ exceptions

## Common to all builds

> On Windows, SEH is always in
>
> Static run-time lib is always used

### /LTCG aka "Link Time Code Generation" 

Must be set to "No" for clang builds

## Only x64

32 bit builds are not built.

## The core of the stunt

"Shared code"  (VStudio project type) "dbj-fwk-code" collects all the code.

All static lib projets reference that one. That is the only place where we add/remove/update the code. That is propagated to the building projects.

Lib projects have no compilation units. Beside pch.cpp.

> Never enter any code into pch.h or pch.cpp, they are building artefacts only.

The hosting app is built by the same principles. Each hosting app build type references matching lib from here.

## Naming is important

Extremely important. There is no tool to make this painless, just the rule:
```xml
<"base name"> + <"clang" | ""> + <"no cppx" | "cppx >
```

- if no "clang" in the name , cl is used
- "cppx" stands for cpp exceptions
  - SEH is intrinsic to Windows and is always present. 
    - One can use it or ignore it.

## What's the big deal with C++ exceptions?

- They are not invented to be used for local error handling
  - sometimes called "in place error handling"
- They make slow code
- They make big code
